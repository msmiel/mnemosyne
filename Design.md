# Design Principles


## SOLID
First defined by Robert C. Martin in 2000.

1. Single responsibility : a class should have only a single responsibility
2. Open/Closed : Open for extension, but closed to modification.
3. Liskov Substitution :
4. Interface Segregation : many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
5. Dependency Inversion : One should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."
