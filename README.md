# Welcome

My goal with this repo is to collect great articles or other things I'd like to remember for later and share with others that's platform agnostic. I did the same thing in a Google doc, but I got tired of formatting it and having to 'add' people to it.


## Things I want to add

- Ethics
- Leadership, Onboarding, and how to make tech more inclusive
- Language specific resource

## What's up with the name?

I majored in Ancient Greek, and Technology means "The study of art skill or crafts" and Mnemosyne is the Goddess of Memory.
