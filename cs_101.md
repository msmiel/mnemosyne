# Computer Science Basics

The building blocks of computers. Please group algorithms and data structures by language if it dives into a particular implementation. Otherwise, stick it in theory.

## Theory

- [Communicating Sequential Processes by Hoare (PDF Article)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/819-f09/Hoare78.pdf)
- [Algorithms](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/)
- [B-Trees](https://jameshunt.us/writings/btrees.html)

## Lectures & Talks

- [MIT Intro to Computer Science & Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pij6J0HsYFA)

## Language Specific Implementations
